	[Head/Waist Follow Mouse/Camera Script.]
	[Works with both R6 and R15, lets you turn your character's head and waist towards your mouse/camera.]
	[Scripted by (Unknown), upgraded by OhHeyItsCory.]
	[I'm not sure who made the original script and the person I found it from definitely didn't make it.]
	[If you find the original creator, please let me know so I can properly credit them <3]
	[Anyways, here's a list of what I've added.]
	[Waist rotation. (Previously, only the head turned.)]
	[Tweening. (Basically, animating the rotation instead of instantly turning.)]
	[Full body rotation. (If set to true, rotates the entire body towards the mouse.)]
	[Specific rotation limits. (The original script used one variable to set the limits of both horizontal and vertical rotation, now there's variables for both limits!)]
